## RICE Scoring Formula üìä

The RICE score is calculated using the following formula:

RICE Score = (Impact / Effort) + (Reach + Confidence) * 0.5
Copy


- **Impact** and **Effort** are the primary variables.
- **Reach** and **Confidence** have a smaller weight in the calculation.

Tasks are categorized as follows:
- **Big Bets**: RICE Score ‚â• 10
- **Quick Wins**: RICE Score ‚â• 5
- **Fill-ins**: RICE Score ‚â• 2
- **Money Pit**: RICE Score < 2
